# Jupyter Lab App
A simple electron app for Jupyter Lab, because that's all I wanted

Based on the wonderful quick start eletron app: https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start

## To use
All you need to do in clone the repo and then run `npm install` + `npm build`.

Once it boots for the first time if you have Jupyter Lab running in the background it'll ask for your token once, and thats it!

Cheers!
